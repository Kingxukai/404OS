		# For qemu version >= 6.0, exception would be raised if no PMP enty is
		# configured. So just configure one entny, which allows all the whole
		# 32-bits physical address range is R/W/X.
		# FIXME: I say it is a temporary workaroud due to I think the patch
		# above contains bug, and I have raised new issue to qemu but it has not
		# been rootcaused till now. Details please refer to
		# https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/585 or
		# https://gitee.com/unicornx/riscv-operating-system-mooc/issues/I441IC (in chinese)
		# So it's just a temporary workaround till now to not block people who
		# want to try newer qemu (>= 6.0)."
		thanks all
